# FaceDetection
Detecting faces in images using Open CV and Haar Cascades.

This requires Open CV, Python, Haar Cascades training data and suitable OS platform (Mac, Linux or Windows). For specific version please check vendor websites for the latest.

I used Python 3.6 on a test machine running Windows 7 Professional (i3 2.1 GHz Arrandale).
To determine which version of Python you have installed, type the following on your terminal or command prompt:

python --version

OpenCV 3.4.3 was used with this project, suitable for Python 3.6. To determine if you have properly installed OpenCV, type the following from the python command line:

#FaceLandmark
Frst you have to download this file for using dlib shape predictor.
You have to download the .dat file and (http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 ) and place in the same directory as the python script â€“ or update the python script with the path to the download.
